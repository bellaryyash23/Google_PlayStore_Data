# Wrestle the Android App Store Data into Beautiful Looking Charts with Plotly & Pandas of Python

🌟Have you ever thought about building your own an iOS or Android app? If so, then you probably have wondered about how things work in the app stores.

🌟Replicate some of the app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies. This stuff is BIG business!

👉We compared thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:

❓How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are?

❓Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity?

❓How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free?

❓How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app?

❓Which paid apps have had the highest revenue

❓How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue

👉We have answered all these questions Using Pandas for Data explorations and Plotly for creating Beautiful visualization of these analysis.

👉All this and much more is achieved using methods like:

✅Pull a random sample from a DataFrame using .sample()

✅Find duplicate entries with .duplicated() and .drop_duplicates()

✅Convert string and object data types into numbers with .to_numeric()

✅Use plotly to generate beautiful pie, donut, and bar charts as well as box and scatter plots and many more.

🌟Here's the sample of the notebook with all these plots and analysis visualized for user to refer to:
